#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) (linear)

a = 0
while (a < n _ n _ n): #occurs n times
a = a + n \* n #occurs 1 time

n loop executions

---

1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4

b) O(n^3)

sum = 0
for i in range(n): # occurs n times
i += 1
for j in range(i + 1, n): # occurs n-1 times
j += 1
for k in range(j + 1, n): # occurs n-2 time
k += 1
for l in range(k + 1, 10 + k): # occurs 10 times
l += 1
sum += 1

n total loop executions (as evidenced by new sum value)

---

<5 0
5 99
6 423
7 1125

as input scales upwards, loop executions scale (n*n-1*n-2\*10), where n^3 is the dominant term

c) O(n)

def bunnyEars(bunnies):
if bunnies == 0:
return 0

      return 2 + bunnyEars(bunnies-1)

n loop executions

---

1 1
2 2
3 3

essentially just counts down recursively from n, so scales with n

## Exercise II

n := [1,2,3,4,5]
f :=2

def find_floor(n,f):

work like recursive binary search:
#find middle as current floor
current=(n[0] + n[-1])//2

if egg breaks on current but DOESN'T break on current-1:
#base case, success, we found it
return middle
elif egg breaks on current AND on current-1 # floor is lower
return find_floor(n[:middle], f)
else: egg doesn't break # floor is further up
return find_floor(n[middle:], f)

Binary search improves with speed with every loop, so runtime complexity --> O(log n)
